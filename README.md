appLayout
=========

A flexbox based application layout, where the content panes can be resized and reordered with drag and drop.
Note: Vertical containers can only be split horizontally, whereas horizontal containers only vertically.

Demo available on [speich.net](http://www.speich.net/projects/programming/flexbox-layout.html)

The purpose of this article is to show you the power of HTML5 for application development insbesondere the flexbox layout.
 The user will be able to drag and drop panes around to completely rearrange or and create a new application layout which suits them the best.
 To see what I mean, have a look at the demo. You can drag each pane around and drop it in a new location. Readers familiar
 with Adobe Bridge or Adobe

We will make use of the following web technologies: css transitions, flexbox layout, dojo toolkit (no, for once its' not jQuery ;-), drag n drop
css variables.

1.
Lets start with our initial application layout. It is made up of a header, main and footer element. The main contains our
base elements contentPane (show image). Are layed out in a flexbox layout see article...

I find it hard to remember, that flex-direction column means the stretching not the result of the child items.

Each base element is div element of class contentPane and consists of a header and a section element.

Dropping within a contentPane means splitting into two (implemented as insert parent and insertBefore/after), dropping between (above, below, left right) insert new contentPane

We add three divs to display possible drop targets within the contentPane, we also add put them in a paneContainer to be able to implement the insert later.

Nest lets add the transition to depict a potential drop target when dragging on hover
show bow-shadow transition only after start of drag by adding the corresponding class

2.
In the next step we add the vertical separators, which later will allow the user to resize the contentPanes, they also serve as a dropping target
